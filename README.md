I'm happy to be working on a really interesting project called **GuauGuau**, to help stray dogs in Mexico not gonna dox myself, but the technologies and idea are superb (Rails, Android, and dogs ‚ù§Ô∏è), if you wanna help you can check [this](https://github.com/luisccc99/guau-guau) or [this](https://github.com/luisccc99/guau-guau-back) repository.

I'm currently learning how Spring Boot works (I think it's a superb framework for web apps) and doing some React Native projects [here](https://github.com/luisccc99/dear_react_native). I just finished one app (One Step Closer To Mars) where I fetch photos from some Mars Rovers (Curiosity, Spirit and Opportunity).
